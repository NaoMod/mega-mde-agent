# Dataset Generation Workflow

## Overview

This folder outlines a workflow for generating datasets by leveraging a megamodel repository. The process involves extracting key components, performing analyses, generating insights, sampling APIs, and producing validated instruction–API class pairs.

## Single and Multi-Tool Instructions

The dataset generation produces two types of instruction datasets:

### Single-Tool Instructions (`simple_generate.py`)

- Instructions requiring one tool operation (get or apply)
- Generation process:
  1. Loads available tools from the ATL MCP server
  2. Creates 5 instructions per tool, balanced between "get" and "apply" operations
  3. Uses LLM to generate diverse natural language instructions
  4. Ensures uniqueness by deduplicating based on instruction text
  5. Default target: 500 instructions

### Multi-Tool Instructions (`multi_simple_generate.py`)

- Instructions requiring a sequence of two tools
- Generation process:
  1. Creates balanced workflow combinations across 4 patterns:
     - get→get (configuration comparison)
     - get→apply (check config, then transform)
     - apply→get (transform, then check config)
     - apply→apply (two transformations in sequence)
  2. Ensures pattern diversity through stratified sampling
  3. Default target: 400 instructions

### Dataset Analysis (`analyze_dataset.py`)

- Evaluates dataset diversity metrics, including:
  - Distinct-n scores (lexical diversity)
  - Vocabulary size and lexical density
  - Average pairwise distances and dispersion
  - Cross-similarity with seed instructions

## Original Workflow Steps

1. **Initialize**: Start with a megamodel repository and query AI models/capabilities.
2. **Extract**: Pull MCPServers, MCPTools, and MCPCapabilities.
3. **Analyze**:
   - Build a capability graph.
   - Identify historical workflow patterns.
4. **Generate Insights**: Derive insights from capabilities and common patterns.
5. **Sample APIs**: Perform API sampling/selection.
6. **Generate Pairs**: Use an LLM to create instruction–API class pairs.
7. **Validate & Output**: Validate results and produce the final dataset.
